This is a C program to simulate a DFA (Deterministic Finite Automata).  
  
This program takes multiple strings from a file as input.  
Then it process the input strings on the defined DFA in the header.  
And tells the string is accepted or rejected by the DFA.  
The output is stored in another output file.
